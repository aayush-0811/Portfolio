## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- The page will reload when you make changes.
- You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

- It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!  
For more details, see the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you're unsatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This will:

- Remove the single build dependency from your project.
- Copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project.

**Use this feature cautiously.**
